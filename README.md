# AWS ML Engineer Capstone Project
#### Summary
The goal of this project is to analyze data collected by the company to optimize mailing campaigns for their customers. Additionally, the project helps Arvato identify individuals who are likely to become customers through clustering and comparisons between the general population and existing customers.

  1. Data Exploration and Cleaning: Preparing the dataset for analysis.
  2. Clustering: Comparing population characteristics with those of existing customers.
  3. Customer Conversion Prediction: Using supervised learning to predict the likelihood of a person becoming a customer.

#### Data Description
The dataset is provided by Udacity and Arvato Financial Solutions. It includes four data files and two descriptive files explaining the features:

Customer Segmentation:

    General population demographics
    Customer demographics

Customer Acquisition:

    Training data
    Test data

Description Files:

    Details on data features and categories.

#### Project Design
  Data Exploration:
    
        Assessing and understanding the dataset.
        Cleaning the data for further analysis.
        
  Customer Segmentation:
    
        Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
        Clustering to uncover patterns and similarities.

  Customer Conversion Predictions:
    
        Predicting customer responses.
        Training machine learning models.
        Making final predictions.

#### Dependencies
1. Python 3.10+
2. AWS S3
3. AWS SageMaker
4. JupyterLab (Notebook Instance)
5. Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, Seaborn, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib.pyplot
#### Results
The process has been detailed in the Arvato Project Workbook.ipynb file. and the Project report is also included in PDF form.
